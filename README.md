# High-Earner-classifier

The purpose of this data science project is to predict whether a randomly selected individual is a high earner with enough confidence. To do so, a dataset has been provided which outlines personal and financial information about a group of respondents in the United States. Knowing whether a group of individuals are wealthy is a critical information for various organisations: private companies, such as banks, seek it out to better target them; public companies to better understand them, and government agencies to better serve them. Throughout this report, this dataset will be explored, pre-processed and prepared for a machine learning application. After building and tuning algorithms as well as engineering some of the features on the training data, the best algorithm will be chosen to forecast the target label on the unseen testing data.
